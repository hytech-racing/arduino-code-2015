CAN message reference
general format: byte 1 is the device's 'channel'.
byte 0 is the channel of the target device (for messages
to arduinos or the pi) (also there are a few exceptions)

from motor controller: Channel 'A'
	0x0A0
	0x0A1
	0x0A2
	0x0A4
	0x0A5
	0x0A6
	0x0A7
	0x0AA - state machine information
	0x0AB
	0x0AC
	
from BMS: Channel '0'
	0x001
	0x002
	0x003
	0x004
	0x005
	0x006
	0x007
	
from main arduino: Channel '8'
	0x08C - message to EVDC. byte 0 is 42 to go for launch, 
		25 to stop motor controller (can be restarted with 42),
		and 64 to permanently stop motor controller
	0x083 - message to Raspberry Pi. if byte 1 is 0, then byte 0 is
		the startup progress state. 
		If byte 1 is 1, then byte 0 is an error code.

from EVDC: channel 'C'
	0x0C0 - enable and torque message to motor controller.
	0x0C8 - state of EVDC and brakes. if byte 0 is 0, then EVDC is not launched.
		if byte 0 is 42, then EVDC is launched. byte 1 is brake level, from 0 to 100
	
from rear arduino: channel '2'
	0x020 - message to main arduino. 
		if byte 1 is 1, then there is a thermistor warning. 
		if byte 1 is 2, then there is a thermistor error. 
		If byte 0 is 1, then there is a battery warning. 
		if byte 0 is 2, then there is a battery error.
